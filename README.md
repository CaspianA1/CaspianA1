Currently building a radio show dashboard for the DJs over at *[WBOR 91.1 FM](https://github.com/WBOR-91-1-FM/)*. Built with Rust and SDL2.

I've spent a couple of years building a game as well, called *[Dungeon Dave](https://github.com/CaspianA1/dungeon_dave)*. This project is slightly on pause at the moment (for the sake of the dashboard), but I expect to return to it in the future.

Take a look! It's written fully in C and uses OpenGL for rendering, with SDL2 for window management. Uses tons of state-of-the-art rendering techniques (especially for shadows and ambient occlusion). Most assets were drawn from scratch with *[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)*.
